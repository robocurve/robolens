# 🤖 Inspect Robots

### The [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/) for robotics

**An open-source evaluation framework for physical AI and VLA (vision-language-action) models.**

Define a robotics benchmark once, then run *any* policy against *any* compatible
embodiment — a real robot or a simulator — with reproducible logs and first-class
[Rerun](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun) visualization.

## One framework, two swappable inputs

LLM evaluations have a single swappable input: the model. **Robotics evaluations
have two** — and Inspect Robots makes both first-class and orthogonal:

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **`Policy`** — the VLA | The "brain". Maps an observation + instruction to an **action chunk** (a horizon of actions executed open-loop, as π0 / ACT / diffusion policies do). |
| 🦾 **`Embodiment`** — the robot or sim | The "body + world". Produces observations, executes actions, owns the action/observation spaces and control rate. Real-robot-first; sims are a stricter special case. |

A **`Task`** — a dataset of `Scene`s (initial conditions, instructions, success
targets) plus scorers — is defined *independently* of both. Before any rollout,
Inspect Robots checks the `(policy, embodiment)` pair is **compatible** (action/observation
spaces, semantics, control rate, scene realizability) and fails fast if not.

## Install

```bash
pip install inspect-robots            # core (numpy only)
pip install "inspect-robots[rerun]"   # + Rerun visualization
```

## Quickstart

No hardware or simulator needed — the dependency-free `CubePick` mock world
exercises the whole stack:

```python
from inspect_robots import eval
from inspect_robots.mock import CubePickEmbodiment, ScriptedPolicy
from inspect_robots.scene import Scene
from inspect_robots.scorer import success_at_end
from inspect_robots.task import Task

task = Task(
    name="cubepick-reach",
    scenes=[Scene(id=f"layout-{i}", instruction="reach the cube", init_seed=i) for i in range(5)],
    scorer=success_at_end(),
    max_steps=80,
)

# The two swappable inputs: a policy (VLA) and an embodiment (robot/sim).
(log,) = eval(task, ScriptedPolicy(), CubePickEmbodiment())
print(log.status, log.results.metrics)   # success {'success_at_end': 1.0}
```

…or from the command line (components resolve from a registry):

```bash
inspect-robots list                                          # registered components
inspect-robots run --task cubepick-reach --policy scripted --embodiment cubepick
inspect-robots inspect logs/cubepick-reach_*.json            # results table
```

## Why Inspect Robots

- 🌍 **Real-world first.** Interfaces assume real-robot reality — human-in-the-loop
  reset, no privileged success oracle, wall-clock control rate. Simulators just
  offer more (seeding, privileged success, rendering) via opt-in capabilities.
- 🔁 **Reproducible.** Every run yields an immutable, schema-versioned `EvalLog`
  with the resolved config, git revision, and package versions — re-readable across
  releases, and re-scorable offline.
- 🪶 **Light core.** Depends only on NumPy. Rerun and simulator/VLA backends are
  optional extras and separately installable plugins.
- 🛑 **Safe unattended.** An explicit error taxonomy separates "record and continue"
  from "halt and require a human", so a faulted robot never auto-advances overnight.
- 🎞️ **Rerun visualization.** Stream camera images, 3D poses, joint/action
  time-series, and success markers to a `.rrd` recording.
- 🧩 **Pluggable.** Ship `inspect-robots-maniskill` or `inspect-robots-openvla` as separate
  packages — entry points make them appear in `inspect-robots list` automatically.
- ⚙️ **VLA-native.** Action chunking, open-loop execution, and ACT/ALOHA temporal
  ensembling are built in, with action *semantics* (control mode, rotation
  representation, gripper, frame) that make compatibility and ensembling correct.

## How it maps to Inspect AI

If you know [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/), you already know Inspect Robots.

| Inspect AI | Inspect Robots |
|---|---|
| `Model` | `Policy` (VLA) **+** `Embodiment` *(two inputs)* |
| `Task = dataset + solver + scorer` | `Task = scenes + controller + scorer` |
| `Sample` | `Scene` |
| `Solver` chain | `Controller` middleware (chunking, ensembling, smoothing) |
| `eval()` → `EvalLog` | `eval()` → `EvalLog` |
| `@task` / `@solver` / `@scorer` + registry | `@task` / `@policy` / `@embodiment` / `@scorer` + entry points |

This repository is the **framework** (the "Inspect AI for robotics"). Concrete
benchmarks (the "Inspect Evals for robotics") and backend adapters live in
separate plugin packages.

## Development

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv run pre-commit install          # ruff + mypy on commit, 100% coverage on push
uv run pytest --cov                 # 100% coverage required
uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy
```

Pre-commit hooks and a blocking CI coverage gate keep `main` green. See
