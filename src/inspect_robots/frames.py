"""FrameStore — rollout-owned streaming of camera frames to disk (R5).

A long multi-camera episode would exhaust memory if every frame were retained in
the [`TrialRecord`][inspect_robots.rollout.TrialRecord]. Instead the rollout streams frames to
disk through a [`FrameStore`][inspect_robots.frames.FrameStore] and keeps only lightweight
[`FrameRef`][inspect_robots.frames.FrameRef]
handles. This is owned by the rollout, NOT by any log sink, so trajectories are
recorded (and scorable) independent of which optional sinks are enabled.
