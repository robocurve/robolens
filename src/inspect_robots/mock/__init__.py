"""Dependency-free mock world and policies for testing and demos.

``CubePick`` is a deterministic 2D toy world: an end-effector must reach a cube.
It exercises the full stack — chunked open-loop execution, scoring, logging — in
CI with no hardware or simulator. This module must never import optional
dependencies (rerun, torch).
