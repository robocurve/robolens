"""The Embodiment interface — Inspect Robots's second swappable input.

An [`Embodiment`][inspect_robots.embodiment.Embodiment] is the "body + world": a real robot or a
simulator. It
produces observations, executes actions, and owns the action/observation spaces,
the native control rate, and reset/safety machinery.

Designed around real-robot reality: ``reset`` may drive to a home pose and block
on human confirmation; there is no guaranteed privileged success oracle.
Simulators are a stricter special case that opt into extra ``capabilities``.

Per R1 (see the design doc): ``step()`` returns as soon as the command is issued
and does NOT block for the control period — the framework owns pacing — unless
the embodiment declares the ``"self_paced"`` capability.
