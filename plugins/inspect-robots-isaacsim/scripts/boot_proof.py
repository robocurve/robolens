"""Boot-only proof: launch Isaac Sim via the Inspect Robots adapter on the real install.

Run with the venv that has isaacsim/isaaclab, and Inspect Robots + this package on the
PYTHONPATH. Confirms the adapter's lazy bring-up (`_ensure_app`) reaches a live
`SimulationApp` on the GPU, then closes cleanly. Does NOT need `isaaclab_tasks`.
